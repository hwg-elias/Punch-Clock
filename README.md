## Some technical details

At first, to initialize the project you can use teminal command ```yarn start``` by default, however it does not prevent you from being able to use ```npm``` as well if configured.

The project relies on using migrations and to configure right is required to change [.env_example]() name to ".env" only and alter the informations inside to yours, then use terminal command ```yarn db:migrate``` to load all the migrations of create and alter tables in database, after that, use ```yarn db:seed``` to populate database with some datas preseteds, so it is possible to check some of funcionalities without send every single data by hands.

To register new companies and users, the account type have to be "admin", if not you can't be able to access this routes. (After login, copy and place the token as a Bearer Token at another routes) So to make this possible, in the seeds, one of the account registered is an admin type as seen below.
